## Memory_Game
Memory Game is a small fun, but challenging tile based memory game. Simply start the round and flip as many pairs as you can to increase your memory score.


## Freeze Power Up $ Timer
you only have 60 seconds to flip as many pairs as you can, although this time cannot be increased, every 10 seconds a random card will receive a Freeze power up. If you are able to match its pair within 10 seconds of appearing, you will freeze the timer for 15 seconds. Just be careful not  to focus on freezing to early in a round when it is more difficult.

# Score
Although you receive a set amount of points for every pair matched, you do receive a star bonus of 1000 per star if you manage to clear a round of cards with minimal incorrect flips.
When a round of cards is cleared, all cards and star bonus will be reset and you will be able to continue pairing cards.(Star bonus is only awarded on completion of a round of cards).

# Dependencies
My memory game runs off of javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, using css grids for the layout. aside from this Im also using TimeCircles(https://github.com/wimbarelds/TimeCircles) for the timer animation and Odometer(https://github.hubspot.com/odometer/) for the score styling.
